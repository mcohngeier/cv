    title: Objective
    summary: |
      I have quite a bit of experience in technology, but lack a formal degree in Computer Science. 
      The goal of this project is to shore up my technical skills to be at least as academic as those covered during the curriculum of an undergraduate or graduate degree in CS.

methodology:
    title: Methodology
    summary: |
      For each class, I completed work equivalent to a student taking the class at the university.  
      I always used materials directly from the course website where available, but supplemented with MOOCs to make use of autograders or if university materials were unavailable.<br><br>
      I self-graded problem sets and exams where autograders were unavailable. 
      Admittedly, self-grading introduces some bias. 
      However, many of the solution sets had relatively strict rubrics. 
      In most cases, I did not give any partial credit, only doing so when the answer was generally correct but had some minor mistake. 
      In some cases, problem sets and exams were available, but no solutions; in these cases, I did not grade the work. I invite anyone to compare my answers to the model solutions.<br><br>
      Due to concerns over publishing answers to course materials, all repositories are private. However, please email me if you wish to see my work.
